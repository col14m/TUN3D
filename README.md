### Installation

**The repository is divided into two modules:**

1. **[Reconstruction](./reconstruction/)**
2. **[Recognition](./recognition/)**

Each module requires a separate installation of dependencies. Please follow the installation guide provided in each module‚Äôs directory.

### Data preprocessing

* Preprocessing instructions and scripts are located in the corresponding folders: **[`Scannet`](./data/scannet/)**, **[`S3DIS`](./data/s3dis/)**, **[`Structured3d`](./data/structured3d/)**.
* All preprocessed datasets are also available on **Hugging Face**. The installation guide provides detailed steps on how to download them correctly.


### Running 

After completing the data preprocessing stage, navigate to the [`recognition`](./recognition/) folder and follow the instructions provided there.
